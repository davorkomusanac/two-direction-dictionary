Dictionary where words can be written and read, and can translate both ways (English and Finnish)

This is a project that was done through a MOOC course (Object-Oriented programming with Java, part II) by University of Helsinki. 
This specific project (exercise 35.) was a project during week 11 ( https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-11/ ).

As it is a part of the course, it is validated through TMC which runs the tests online, so my project had to be modified in some parts to accommodate the tests so that I would points for it.

This is how the project should work:

 The dictionary has to implemented that words can be both read and written into the file. Also, the dictionary has to translate in both directions, from Finnish into English and from English into Finnish (in this exercise, we suppose unofficially that Finnish and English do not have words which are spellt the same).
